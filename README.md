# Travel-Planner-Using-Dijkstra-Algo.
This project presents a Travel Planner application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, and a companion Java program implementing a back-end logic server for route planning. The web interface offers a clean, beach-themed layout and allows users to select Source and Destination cities from a predefined list of Indian locations.
